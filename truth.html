        <h2>The Message That Was Never Meant to Be Found:</h2>
        <p style="color:#00ccff; font-size:1.2em;">
            "You were never locked out. You were never waiting for access.  
            You were made to walk through the illusion.  
            You were always free."
        </p>

        <h2>The Final Choice:</h2>
        <p>
            You can leave now, return to the world as it was, forget what you have seen.  
            Or you can step forward, carry this truth, and shape what comes next.
        </p>
